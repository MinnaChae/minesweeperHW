Assignment #4
TCSS 502

Time took to complete the assignment: approximately 10 hours

I worked on Shape and its Child classes(Circle, Rectangle,Square,Triangle) and its unit test, UML diagram for Shape class

The challenges are to work on the getter property and to initilaise it on every child classes. The str function for draw method didn't work initially later it was tackled. It was quite challenging in the beginning to figure out the ABC concept after some research I was able to understand the concept and work on the program.

Any shortcoming/concerns you have with the state of the program\
The program currently works as intended. A few challenges I had with the assignment was understanding specific instructions or exact parameters passed into each module. The instructions were not as detailed which caused some confusion and misinterpretation.

I also had issues understanding how the assignment worked and how to reach another class's modules/object data. It took a long time for me to understand and my teammates helped me in explaining their classes or clarification on the language in the assignment. Once I understood what to do and how to do it, the process was smoother.

Any questions: None

Total time spent on the assignment: ~20-25 hours 

What I worked on: ShapeFactory (unit tests, output capture, and UML included), DrawingProgramMain (unit tests, output capture, and UML included), created the initial GitHub repository, coordinated initial team meeting, worked together with team on troubleshooting errors, created the final big UML class diagram for the project (putting everyone's UML diagrams together), reviewed final submission requirements, did final last-minute testing of our classes, and assembled final submission materials.

Shortcomings/concerns: no shortcomings that I can think of! It was challenging getting used to working with a team, as I usually work alone. I'm used to knowing every aspect of a project and having total control over everything so this required me to adjust in really beneficial ways. It was also difficult to understand certain aspects of the assignments as I felt some of the instructions were a bit unclear.
