any shortcomings your solution has
I unit tests were difficult. Last quarter we didn't have lectures/overviews on unit testing so it was difficult to
know what how or what to write the unit tests. Due to not having a deep understanding of unit tests, it was diffcult to
know what criteria would satisfy the homework.
